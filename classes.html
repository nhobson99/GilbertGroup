	<h3>MSE 201: Introduction to Materials Science (F2018, F2019)</h3>
	<p>This class serves as an introduction to materials science and engineering for many of the engineering majors - and others who are interested in the subject. The materials around us, developed over the melenia of human civilization, enable modern technologies, and understanding the multi-scale structures which determine the properties of a material are clearly key to new discoveries. This class provides an introduction to Materials Science, building up from the fundamental units - the atom - through bonding, nanoscale structures, microscale structures and imperfections.</p>
	<p>The second half of the course covers how these structures define the properties of materials, focusing on mechanical properties, such as the stress strain curve and materials processing, and ending with functional properties (magnetic, electronic, optical, thermal). This class was very exciting for me by enriching my physics background with practical, real world systems.</p>

	<h3>MSE 120: Impact of Materials on Society (S2020)</h3>
	<p>This is a new course at UTK, modeled after a similar course developed at the University of Florida by Prof. Kevin Jones. The course seeks to highlight how materials science and materials development have altered the trajectory of human civilization, using historical based evidence to highlight changes in human society, culture, politics and economics. It is easy to be unaware of the luxuries that modern materials afford us, and that these luxuries were not always there - such as the relative scarcity of aluminum before the 1900’s or plastic before the 1960’s. It is also easy to miss how materials development has tangentially impacted human civilization in more indirect ways - for example, the transition from wood to coal was largely driven by demands for metal; coal has subsequently impacted our environment, leading to a demand for alternative energy sources.</p>
	<p>The availability or scarcity of materials has been largely attributed as a major cause for the current global distribution of power, and will be key to defining this distribution in the future. The critical impacts of materials in history are emphasized by the naming of entire epochs of human development by the materials that define them (think stone-age, copper/bronze/iron/steel ages, the age of silicon). Walking a fine line between the materials science and social science, this class will demonstrate this often misunderstood concept.</p>
