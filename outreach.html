	<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://utkshpe.weebly.com/about-us.html" style="color:#FF8C00;">Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers</a></h4>
	<p>For 2020 I will have the privilege of being the academic adviser for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, an organization which seeks to promote young engineers from all fields.</p>

<br><br>

	<h4><a href="https://volweb.utk.edu/~dgilber8/SeniorDesign.html" style="color:#FF8C00;">Senior Design Projects</a></h4>
	<p>As part of their undergraduate education, Materials Science students at the University of Tennessee participate in a senior design project, working with an active research lab. Our lab has participated in this program by mentoring these teams.</p>

<br><br>

	<h4 style="color:#FF8C00;">Rural Youth for Science and Engineering (RYSE)</h4>
	<p>Our in-development K-12 and public outreach program to engage youth in science and technology programs. These communities tend to have poor exposure to exciting science demonstrations, which is key to drawing youth into STEM fields. This program will include a 6' demonstration Tesla coil, exotic materials (aerogels and vantablack), ferrofluids, as-well-as chemistry and aroma (food science) demonstrations.</p>
