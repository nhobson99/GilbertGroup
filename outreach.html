		<h2>Outreach Programs</h2>
		<p></p>

		<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://utkshpe.weebly.com/about-us.html" style="color:#FF8C00;">Society of
				Hispanic Professional Engineers</a></h4>
		<p>For 2020, Dustin Gilbert will have the privilege of being the academic adviser for the Society of Hispanic
			Professional
			Engineers, an organization which seeks to promote young engineers from all fields.</p>

		<br><br>

		<h4><a href="https://volweb.utk.edu/~dgilber8/SeniorDesign.html" style="color:#FF8C00;">Senior Design
				Projects</a></h4>
		<p>As part of their undergraduate education, Materials Science students at the University of Tennessee
			participate in a senior design project, working with an active research lab. Our lab has participated in
			this program by mentoring these teams.</p>

		<br><br>

		<h4 style="color:#FF8C00;">Rural Youth for Science and Engineering (RYSE)</h4>
		<p>Our in-development K-12 and public outreach program to engage youth in science and technology programs. These
			communities tend to have poor exposure to exciting science demonstrations, which is key to drawing youth
			into STEM fields. This program will include a 6' demonstration Tesla coil, exotic materials (aerogels and
			vantablack), ferrofluids, as-well-as chemistry and aroma (food science) demonstrations.</p>

		<br><br>
		<h4 style="color: #FF8C00">Early Introductions to STEM</h4>
		<p>The best way to bring more attention to STEM fields is to start at an early age. Liz showed her sister
			around
			the lab with Dustin, shown below. She was able to ask questions that interested her, learned a lot, and
			most
			importantly, had fun!</p>
