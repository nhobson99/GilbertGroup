<p><font color="darkorange" size="6"><center>Welcome to the website for the “<b>Accelerating Discovery of Novel High Entropy Alloys and Oxides with Multiple Functionalities</b>” workshop.</center></font></p>
<br>
<p>This workshop will highlight high entropy materials – emphasizing their unique qualities including distributions in atomic mass, size, electronegativity, spin, and inter-atomic coupling – focusing on their functional properties – including magnetism, thermoelectricity, superconductivity, optical, and electronic among others. The workshop agenda is designed to identify the opportunities for high entropy materials in functional applications, develop a roadmap to discover and develop these opportunities, and finally to make collaborative connections between research teams and also to relevant funding agencies. After the workshop, a representative summary will be compiled and shared with the attendees.</p>
<br>
<p>On behalf of the organizing committee, thank you kindly for your participation, this work could not be completed without your involvement and patronage. I am looking forward to meeting you all in DC!</p>

<h3>Conference Summary:</h3>
<p><font size="4">High entropy (HE) compounds offer fantastic opportunities for new functional materials and present intriguing systems for exploring multiscale physics. The large distribution in atomic masses, internal strains, and bond lengths/angles/strengths lead to intrinsically mixed phase systems which presents unique opportunities for novel materials with multiple functionalities, i.e. piezoelectric, thermoelectric, superconducting, or magnetic. The goal of this workshop is to create a research roadmap that accelerates the transition from viewing HE compounds as primarily structural materials to realizing their potential as multifunctional materials. To achieve this goal, the workshop will assemble current experts in HE compounds and functional materials to address the following focus topics: (1) Establish the current state-of-the-art HE materials, what makes an “ideal” functional material and how these topics overlap, (2) identify techniques to navigate the vast HE parameter space, focused on the coupling of machine learning and rapid materials synthesis, (3) develop multiscale modeling and simulation approaches to link atomistic changes to macroscopic material properties with real-world applications, and (4) integration of these aspects into a new “rules-based” materials design process.  Discussions will be conducted exploring how the disorder within high entropy materials can uniquely address existing challenges within materials science.  These discussions will take place within the context of achieving HE materials which demonstrate functional properties in parameter spaces relevant to technological applications. This forum will identify target materials and material systems and describe the research tools, techniques, and projects that are needed to advance this frontier. Completion of these projects would establish a foundation for the intelligent design of HE compounds as materials designed to function in cutting-edge technologies. </font> </p>
