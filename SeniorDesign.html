	<p>We will host a team of five undergraduate MSE seniors in the design and construction of a high-voltage electrospinner, then the fabrication, testing and optimization of electrospun textiles for Covid-19 response. This project is funded by the National Science Foundation RAPID program, which is tasked with developing a scientific response to the Coronavirus pandemic with improved testing and prevention tools and techniques.</p>

	<h4>Senior Design 2020B</h4>
	<p>In addition to leading the electrospinning effort, we are also supporting a second project with Prof. Rack investigating the magnetic properties of high-entropy alloys. This work will generate wafers with graded composition, measure their magnetic properties and use machine learning to predict un-measured samples, and samples which are not even on the wafer.</p>

	<p>In the Spring of 2019 we hosted a team of five undergraduate MSE students (Melanie Buziak, Cullen Pearson, Caitlin Harpell, Morgan Yount, Trent Charnock) tasked with building a thermal evaporator system. The design required an intricate understanding of vacuum systems, high-power electronics, and thermal management. As a consequence of the Coronavirus pandemic, the project was cut short, ending in mid-March (two months into a four month project). At the end of the project, the students had assembled the vacuum system, designed and fabricated a custom hearth and installed it in the chamber, installed the high-power feedthroughs, designed a custom sample holder, installed the pumps and manometers, and were able to pull pressures of <1 mTorr (from a roughing pump only). An extremely talented team of researcher with a bright and exciting future! </p>
